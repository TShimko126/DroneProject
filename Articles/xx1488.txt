Research on the Higgs boson isn't the only work to come out of CERN, the world's
largest particle laboratory, in recent years. In 2011, the organization
announced a new program, Collide@CERN, to support collaboration between artists
and physicists on its campus in the suburbs of Geneva. The first two recipients
of these creative residencies were the Swiss choreographer Gilles Jobin and the
German visual artist Julius von Bismarck, who pooled their investigations to
create ''Quantum.''

The hybrid piece -- part dance, part incandescent installation -- will have its
United States premiere at the Brooklyn Academy of Music's Next Wave Festival on
Thursday. Mapping ideas about subatomic behavior into macroscopic terms,
''Quantum'' derives something optically striking from a realm we can't see. As
Carla Scaletti's sound score crackles and drones, a row of hanging lamps churns
above six dancers, attuned to subtle shifts in their movement. (Through
Saturday, Fishman Space, BAM Fisher, 321 Ashland Place, Fort Greene;
