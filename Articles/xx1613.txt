A strip too political for the comics

SECTION: EDITORIAL COPY; Pg. A13

LENGTH: 212 words


Is it funny to muse about killing politicians with a drone, as was done in the
March 15 installment of "Prickly City"? I don't think so. It could get you
arrested, not paid and published.

Considering the content of the recent "Prickly City" comic strips, especially
from March 13 through 15, wouldn't it be more appropriate to run it on the
editorial page? The strip strongly advocated electing to Congress people who
would overturn "Obamacare."

The comic strip "Prickly City" has now descended from vile to unprintable to
unspeakable. Calling the U.S. president a "giant poopburger" [March 15] should
not be permitted in a newspaper, not even on the comics page. Even if the
cartoonist was referring to the president's policies, which I very much doubt
(after all, President Obama's picture was right under the words), this is still
inappropriate language.

Then on March 18, the strip advocated that young people should "refuse to pay
for their deficit." In a democracy, you don't choose what you pay for; you pay
for what your elected officials vote for. To call on people not to do so comes
close to treason or rebellion.

This kind of talk goes far beyond the limits of political disagreement.
