Peter G. Tsouras's knowledge of modern technology may be a little out of date if
he thinks that citizens armed with hand-held projectile weapons (i.e., guns)
would be able to hold off the government in the event of a disagreement
["Liberties trump benefits," letters, April 20].

Has he seen the resources the government has? How about drones with infrared
sensors that can see his heat signature through the roof of his house? Or the
government's extensive power over the Internet: If it decides to cripple the
Internet, within less than a week there wouldn't be any food or fuel available
to the vast majority of the population.

So-called modern guns are merely souped-up artifacts of the 14th century. They
are no match for 21st-century technology. Their only purpose today is to
encourage a dispute between two angry citizens to escalate into homicide.
