HIGHLIGHT:Â Why can drones be more effective than conventional methods in
surveying archaeological sites?


 In "New to the Archaeologist's Tool Kit: The Drone," William Neuman and Ralph
Blumenthal write about how drones have the potential to address the problem of
endangered archaeological sites quickly and cheaply.

WHO is Luis Jaime Castillo Butters?

WHERE does he live and work?

WHY has he "created a drone air force?"

WHERE else are archaeologists using drones?

WHY are hundreds, perhaps thousands of ancient sites endangered in Peru?

HOW can drones address the problem, quickly and cheaply?WHEN did Dr. Castillo
first realize that drones could be very useful in Peruvian archaeology?

WHY can drones be more effective than conventional methods in surveying
archaeological sites?

WHY is the task of the drone effort so "daunting?"

For Higher-Order Thinking

WHAT are other imaginative uses of drones that you have heard of, or can imagine
yourself?
