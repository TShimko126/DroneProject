This policy has no justification

The May 21 news article "U.S. will release drone strike memo" began: "The
Justice Department will publicly release a secret 2011 memo that provided the
legal justification for the killing of American terrorism suspects overseas,
according to a U.S. official, following extensive pressure on the administration
to do so." The salient word in that sentence is "suspects," meaning that those
killed were never charged with crimes and afforded a fair trial.

That President Obama, formerly a professor of constitutional law, and David J.
Barron, "one of the memo's authors" and an Obama nominee to a federal appeals
court judgeship, could conceive of even a shred of justification for such crimes
boggles the mind.
