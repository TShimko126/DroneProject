The missing property that prompted the lockdown of a Fort Carson armor battalion
is likely a "sensitive item", a category of gear that includes weapons,
ammunition and night vision goggles.

An undisclosed number of soldiers from the 1st Battalion of the 66th Armored
Regiment were confined to their unit's buildings on Fort Carson overnight during
a search for the missing item. The lockdown, which remains in place Friday,
followed a day of searches across the base.

While Army officials won't say what's caused the hubbub, sources tell The
Gazette that the only items that would trigger that kind of reaction are
categorized as "sensitive."

The battalion recently wrapped up a two week training exercise on the southern
side of Fort Carson that saw its soldiers packing a full array of gear from M 4
rifles and M 9 pistols to night vision goggles and Raven miniature drones. When
units return from training its traditional to inventory gear to ensure that
equipment including machine guns and grenades don't end up in the wrong hands.

Fort Carson is reluctant to speak about what was lost or stolen.
