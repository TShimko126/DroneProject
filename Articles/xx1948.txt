Hunt for reconciliation in Congo

Reading the Oct. 29 front-page article "Kony 2013: U.S. intensifies effort in
hunt for warlord," I had a flashback to 1967 when I first lived, studied and
worked in Uganda. There I met mercenaries, missionaries and mine bosses
pillaging Congo, a treasure house of resources.

Now, violent conflict in the region is fueled by a meshwork of security firms
paid by U.S. philanthropists, U.S. troops protecting our "core values,"
nongovernmental organizations (some working in tandem with U.S. religious
groups), an African Union task force, Ugandan soldiers and drones. All this to
pursue warlord Joseph Kony and his ragtag band of fewer than 250 fighters.

While The Post's coverage is commendable, it omitted key aspects of the story:
Many Ugandans, including church leaders, want a local settlement, not external
intervention. Impressive efforts at rehabilitation and post-conflict recovery
are underway. At bottom, the Kony-bad-guy narrative feeds negative stereotypes
that overlook how Africans are solving their own problems. In addition, it is
important to note that the discovery of oil in Uganda and an increasing Chinese
presence are drivers of intervention.

It would be ethically right and politically wise to focus on a negotiated,
rather than military, solution. The way forward is reconciliation.
