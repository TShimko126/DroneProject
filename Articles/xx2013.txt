Stumbling Block for Turkey's Missile Deal With China

HIGHLIGHT: A defense bill before the United States Congress may undercut
Turkey&#8217;s agreement to buy air-defense missile systems from China.


China's agreement with Turkey to sell it more than $3 billion worth of
air-defense missile systems may soon run into a deal-breaker: the United States
Congress.

As Foreign Policy magazine noted this week, the 2014 defense spending bill,
which is expected to be up for a vote this month, stipulates that American funds
cannot be used to integrate China's HQ-9 system into the networks of NATO, of
which Turkey is a member. Turkey is unlikely to want to foot that bill itself,
as it effectively adds millions of dollars to the deal's price tag.

Of course, this is more than just political posturing. A major contender for
Turkey's air defense is the Patriot missile system, which in its latest
iteration is produced by the American defense contractors Raytheon and Lockheed
Martin. (NATO also operates a half-dozen Patriot batteries in Turkey.) With
Patriot systems costing roughly $150 million apiece, according to some reports,
forcing Turkey to start shopping again could be a windfall for those companies -
and a potential blow to China's ambitions as a high-end arms exporter.
