HIGHLIGHT: Ruslana, a Ukrainian pop singer, has been an inspiration and a force
for calm. Just don&#8217;t call her a leader of the popular movement against the
government.


When Ukrainian security forces stormed Kiev's central square on Dec. 11, the pop
singer Ruslana was on stage and attempting to defuse the situation. "I kept a
quiet confidence in myself, and I believe that my voice kept them calm," she
said recently. Ruslana, the 2004 winner of the EuroVision Song Contest, has been
a constant presence at Independence Square, also known as Maidan, since
demonstrators gathered there in late November to protest the government's
decision to postpone an economic agreement with the European Union. She is on
stage every night from midnight until sunrise, keeping thousands of
demonstrators upbeat and energized in freezing temperatures. Many protesters
consider her to be one of the leaders of the movement, but she vehemently
disagrees. "We said that one cannot lead Maidan, one can only join Maidan," she
said.
