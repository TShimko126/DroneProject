Who's Savvy Now?

HIGHLIGHT:Â Maybe policy matters?


Via Digby, Jay Rosen has a very good piece on how some reporting on the CBO
report was distorted by what he calls the "cult of the savvy". It goes beyond
what I said about second-order journalism; Rosen argues that there's a value
system at work, where being in the know about political maneuvering is
considered all-important, whereas understanding the actual policy issue is for
the drones.

The thing is, my read - and yes, I'm doing a bit of second-order journalism
myself for a moment, but bear with me - is that the CBO affair actually ended up
hurting Republicans. By the end of the week a barrage of press reports, plus
those mighty figures Jon Stewart and Stephen Colbert, had effectively changed
the story from "CBO predicts massive job losses" to "Republicans lie about CBO
report." In reality, it's unlikely that it would have mattered at all even if
the first story had stuck. But to the extent that such things matter at all,
Republicans ended up losing the week.

So the savvy cultists were wrong even on their own terms. And notice why they
were wrong: It never occurred to them that understanding the real issues might
matter, and so they were caught completely off guard when Republican lies about
policy matters produced a backlash.

So here's a radical thought: Maybe the truly savvy thing is to take policy
seriously, not to pretend that it's all a game, and that only you understand the
rules?
