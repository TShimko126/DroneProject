Barack Obama, Between Two Ferns

SECTION: OPINION

LENGTH: 91 words



HIGHLIGHT: The president can be frustrating, but he&#8217;s also funny.


 As frustrating as President Obama can be (think drones, wiretapping and
refusing to get a full accounting of torture and rendition), he can also be
incredibly charming and funny. It's hard to imagine any president (including
Bill Clinton) going on "Between Two Ferns" with Zach Galifianakis and doing far
more than just holding his own.
