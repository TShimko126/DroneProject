HIGHLIGHT:Â Google&#8217;s makes its 16th deal so far this year, agreeing to buy
Skybox Imaging, a provider of high-quality satellite images, for about $500
million.


Google's acquisition machine took flight again on Tuesday, as the technology
giant agreed to buy Skybox Imaging, a provider of high-quality satellite images,
for about $500 million.

By purchasing the five-year-old Skybox, Google will initially gain a way to
improve its mapping service. But over time, the company said that it hoped its
newest acquisition - which launches satellites into space as part of its
business - can help bolster both its Internet service offerings and its disaster
relief efforts.

Google has already been working on some novel ways to expand its Internet
access, including through balloons and drones.

"The time is right to join a company who can challenge us to think even bigger
and bolder, and who can support us in accelerating our ambitious vision," Skybox
wrote in a corporate blog post.

The deal is the 16th by Google so far this year, according to Standard & Poor's
Capital IQ.
