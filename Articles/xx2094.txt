Daily Report: Report Implicates 2nd Chinese Army Unit in Online Spying

BYLINE: THE NEW YORK TIMES

HIGHLIGHT: The report, by CrowdStrike, a security company, ties a hacker group
in Shanghai to attacks on governments, contractors and research companies.


Just weeks after the Justice Department indicted five members of the Chinese
army, accusing them of online attacks on United States corporations, a report
released on Monday offers more evidence of the breadth and ambition of China's
campaign to steal trade and military secrets from foreign victims, Nicole
Perlroth reports.

The report, parts of which The New York Times was able to corroborate
independently, ties attacks against dozens of public and private sector
organizations to a group of Shanghai-based hackers whom its authors -
CrowdStrike, an Irvine, Calif., security company - called Putter Panda because
they often focused on golf-playing conference attendees. The National Security
Agency and its partners have identified the hackers as Unit 61486, according to
interviews with a half-dozen current and former American officials.

Those officials say the N.S.A. and its partners are tracking more than 20
hacking groups in China, over half of them units of the People's Liberation
Army, as they break into public and private sector companies, including
satellite, drone and nuclear weapon component makers and technology and energy
companies and research groups.

Unit 61486, researchers say, in some instances shared computing resources and
communicated with members of Unit 61398, the P.L.A. unit whose members were the
focus of last month's indictments. Read more »
