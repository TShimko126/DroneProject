HIGHLIGHT: The Portuguese Navy&#8217;s fledgling drone program attracted
international attention last week because of footage of the failed maiden voyage
of a new reconnaissance craft.


As the Lisbon daily Público reported, the Portuguese Navy's fledgling drone
program attracted international attention last week because of footage of the
failed maiden voyage of a new reconnaissance craft that was quickly viewed
hundreds of thousands of times online.

The less-than-triumphant first flight of the small AR4 Light Ray, which lasted
just seconds before the craft plunged nosefirst into the water just off the edge
of the dock from which it was launched, was witnessed by the nation's defense
minister and naval chief of staff and recorded from at least three angles by
crews from the state broadcaster other journalists.

Before a second, far more successful takeoff, Defense Minister José Pedro
Aguiar-Branco told reporters at the Lisbon Navy Base that the crash, which was
apparently caused by the craft's hitting the shoulder of the marine who tossed
it into the air, just bolstered his case that the government needs to invest in
training for the military. (A promotional video for the drone posted online by
Tekever, the company that developed it in collaboration with Portugal's Navy,
demonstrates the proper technique for hurling it into the air.)

Portugal's defense department later released surveillance video recorded during
the longer test flight, and the navy's own Facebook report on the test made no
mention of the halting start.
