Sobering aerial views of Minnesota under water, after flooding rains

In the last week, excessive rain has swamped portions of Minnesota.

Consider these stats - courtesy the Star Tribune Weather Blog - from
Minneapolis, which has received:

* 25.32 inches of rain so far this year, most on record year-to-date  * 86
percent of its summer (June-August) rainfall, with a week still left in June  *
82 percent of its annual precipitation, with the year not even half over  *
10.85 inches of rain in June compared to an average of 4.25 inches

Writes the New York Times: Minnesota was besieged on Tuesday by some of its most
widespread flooding in years. Water spilled onto streets in downtown St. Paul,
crops of soybeans and corn were damaged and a state of emergency was declared in
35 counties.

Following the deluge, the Mississippi river in St. Paul is forecast to crest at
20.5 feet Thursday, the sixth-highest level on record (and highest in June)
before waters begin to recede.

Among the matter floating down the swollen Mississippi?  A giant clam shell
(not a real shell, but a sculpture from a flooded playground).

Here's aerial footage, filmed from a drone, capturing scenes of flooding in
Waterville, Minnesota - about an hour south of Minneapolis - which was largely
under water Tuesday.
