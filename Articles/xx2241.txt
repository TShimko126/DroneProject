Boatbound brings boat-sharing to the District, and is Tilda Swinton a clone of
David Bowie?

BYLINE: Adam Griffiths

LENGTH: 205 words


- Tilda Swinton neither confirmed nor denied a Redditor's theory that she is, in
fact, a clone of David Bowie.

- A man has been jailed on burglary after Pittsburgh police say he entered a
home uninvited, and was subdued by a resident wielding a fake gun.

- Peeping toms are so last century. One Seattle woman learned this last weekend
when she was walking around her 26th-floor apartment naked and saw a drone
hovering outside her window.

- Buy a whole town for the price of one house in D.C.: A businessman looking to
invest more time in his traveling concession business is seeking a buyer for his
rural, southwestern South Dakota town - for the price of $400,000.

A treat for a Monday morning for all our #HenryCavill fans. Henry is a great
supporter of the @RM1664Challenge! http://t.co/q4HcEqw0Mr

- Henry Cavill is doing a really great job with that Clark Kent look, at least
according to this unofficial photo from the set of "Batman v. Superman: Dawn of
Justice."

- This seems a bit excessive, but a woman in Kansas was arrested for arson when
she set a fire in her duplex to kill a spider.

- You can share your cars, houses and tools - now, a service called Boathound
brings boat-sharing to the D.C. area. (And it's pretty popular.)
