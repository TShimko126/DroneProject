Drone ban flouts free speech, news groups say

You may have heard about farmers, pilots and even real estate agents calling on
the Federal Aviation Administration to allow the use of commercial drones in
U.S. airspace. But now some of the nation's largest news organizations - The
Washington Post, the New York Times, the Associated Press and Gannett, among
others - are saying the FAA is restricting free speech by not allowing drones to
fly.

They say banning drones is a First Amendment violation, according to court
documents filed this week in the case of a filmmaker whom the agency  fined for
using a drone to film an ad.

"This overly broad policy," the brief reads, "implemented through a patchwork of
regulatory and policy statements and an ad hoc cease-and-desist enforcement
process, has an impermissible chilling effect on the First Amendment
newsgathering rights of journalists."

The media organizations filed the brief in support of Raphael Pirker, whom the
FAA  fined $10,000 for using a drone to shoot a commercial at the University of
Virginia. A federal judge threw out the agency's case in March, encouraging
drone advocates, but the FAA is appealing.

News outlets have been eager to use drones in their coverage of events. "Reports
on traffic, hurricanes, wildfires, and crop yields could all be told more safely
and cost-effectively with the use of [drones]," they argued in the brief.
