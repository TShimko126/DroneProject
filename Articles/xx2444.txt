I Can't Wait Till the 22nd Century;
This one isn't panning out.

I thought I'd get out front with this idea. Nobody's talking much about the 22nd
century yet, so I thought I'd lead the way.

It's not too soon. I don't know if you've noticed, but we're WAY into the 21st
century already. It's not a new thing anymore. It's the future we're in now. Or
was. Cuz if this is the future, we waited around for nothing. It is a big
letdown. Smart phones may still excite you, but not me anymore. And they are
about all we have to show for it.

The 21st century is a nothingburger. Not tragic yet, like so much of the 20th
century, but we may still get to that. But in terms of exciting things to think
about, we're pretty badly bumping along on low terrain here. That's where the
22nd century comes in!

I'll be well over a hundred years old, and so will you. But we will look younger
than we do now. And better! (if such a thing is possible). We won't watch
sports, we will play them, like Olymoians, and we won't hit our family members
after the game. We will all be unemployed and loving it. Drones will deliver
free healthy vegetables that look and taste exactly like Buffalo wings. We will
all enjoy threesome sex with a chrome companion and a box turtle. It's going to
be so cool. Let's dream about that, and then wait for it.

Alternatively, we could start talking about something exciting to do with our
culture and talents right now.
