The Pentagon detailed its overnight military strikes in Syria on Tuesday with a
variety of video and still images, saying they were conducted in three waves
beginning around 8:30 EasternÂ Daylight Time.

They began with 47 Tomahawk missile cruise strikes in eastern and northern
Syria, primarily against facilities run by the Khorasan group, a relatively
unknown affiliate of al-Qaeda that defense officials said was plotting attacks
against the United States.

The second wave of attacks began around 9 p.m. EDT, and included strikes by F-22
Raptors, F-15 Strike Eagles, F-16 Fighting Falcons, B-1B Lancer bombers and
drone aircraft in northern Syria. They primarily targeted training camps,
vehicles and other facilities under the control of the Islamic State militant
group, said Army Lt. Gen. William Mayville, director of operations for the Joint
Chiefs of Staff.

The third round of strikes began shortly after midnight Eastern Standard Time,
and incorporated F/A-18 Hornets from the USS George H.W. Bush, an aircraft
carrier in the Persian Gulf, and F-16s flying from unnamed bases in the Middle
East. They primarily dropped bombs in eastern Syria.

Arab partner nations participated in the second and third rounds of strikes.

Mayville showed the following images during a news conference Tuesday, showing
what he said were militant facilities before and after they were hit with
strikes by the United States and partner nations.
