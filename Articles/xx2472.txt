More U.S. government hypocrisy on civilian casualties

BYLINE: David Bernstein

LENGTH: 175 words


Flashback:

Back in July, Deputy National Security Advisor Benjamin Rhodes suggested to
CNN's Candy Crowley that Israel wasn't doing enough to avert civilian casualties
in Gaza. "I think you can always to more. The U.S. military does that in
Afghanistan."

Yesterday, Yahoo News reported: "White House exempts Syria airstrikes from tight
standards on civilian deaths:"

At the same time, however, [NSA spokeswoman Caitlin] Hayden said that a
much-publicized White House policy that President Obama announced last year
barring U.S. drone strikes unless there is a "near certainty" there will be no
civilian casualties - "the highest standard we can meet," he said at the time -
does not cover the current U.S. airstrikes in Syria and Iraq.

The statement "came in response to questions about reports that as many as a
dozen civilians, including women and young children, were killed when a Tomahawk
missile struck the village of Kafr Daryan in Syria's Idlib province on the
morning of Sept. 23."

 UPDATE: "Helluva pinpoint operation" the U.S. is running in Syria.
