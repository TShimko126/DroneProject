access from solar-powered drones or perhaps other &#8220;connectivity

Watch out, Google. Facebook is gunning for the title of World's Coolest Place to

Thursday that the company was creating a new lab of up to 50 aeronautics experts

founders helped to create early versions of an unmanned solar-powered drone, the
Zephyr, which flew for two weeks in July 2010 and broke a world record for time
