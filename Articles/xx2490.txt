QUIZ: Is this from an Obama speech or a GOOP newsletter?

BYLINE: Jaime Fuller

LENGTH: 207 words


On Thursday night, President Obama stopped by Gwyneth Paltrow's house to
consciously uncouple some reliable L.A. donors from their cash. Paltrow seemed
quite excited - in her introduction before the President's speech, she told
Obama he was "so handsome that I can't speak properly" and that she was "one of
your biggest fans, if not the biggest."

L.A., you are in for a Goop-tastic evening. @BarackObama to headline high-$$ DNC

In honor of Paltrow's self-designated status as Obama's biggest fan (she has
some competition), we wanted to show that Paltrow isn't all that different than
her political role model.

For this Fix quiz, we challenge you to tell the difference between lines in
Obama speeches and Gwyneth Paltrow's introductions to her weekly GOOP
newsletters, which offer lifestyle tips for those who want to be Gwyneth
Paltrow. (On GOOP's website, it describes itself as "an eminent lifestyle
publication, dedicated to informing and positively inspiring its audience.) If
you want to make the world a better place, does it matter if you choose drones
and diplomacy over detoxes?

We're about to find out.
