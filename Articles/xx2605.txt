Barack Obama is never too far from a pack of Nicorette and a protein bar, thanks
to his real-life "Gary," trip adviser and "body man" Marvin Nicholson.

In a recent 17,000-word New Yorker profile, which covers a range of heady
topics, from the president's stance on drones to the NSA, we get a glimpse
inside Obama's version of "the Leviathan." That's what eager-beaver assistant
Gary calls the ever-present briefcase he lugs around for his boss on HBO's
"Veep."

As the president's ubiquitous guy Friday (and golfing buddy), Nicholson is ever
ready with a squeeze of Purell or a pen.

"Nicholson is the guy who is always around, who carries the bag and the jacket,"
the New Yorker says. "He is the one who has the pens, the briefing books, the
Nicorette, the Sharpies, the Advil, the throat lozenges, the iPad, the iPod, the
protein bars, the bottle of Black Forest Berry Honest Tea."

In 2008, Reggie Love, then briefcase-carrier-in-chief, told the New York Times
he kept MET-Rx brand chocolate  roasted-peanut protein bars and bottles of Black
Forest Berry Honest Tea on hand 24-7. So it looks like Obama's tastes haven't
changed all that much.
