Best drone ever delivers barbecue to football game

Recently, a drone was spotted at the U.S. Open, near where a match was taking
place between Serena Williams and Flavia Pennetta. The man operating that drone
was arrested, which sounds about right. You just can't have any old knucklehead
flying one of those things into a sports event, or a lot of other unexpected
places, for that matter.

However, Friday brought us news of a drone barging into a sports event in a more
benign way. A more delicious way. A more succulent, slow-cooked way.

At Idaho high school FB game. A drone is delivering what appears to be barbecue
to fans in the stands. I did not know this was possible.

That's Boise State Public Radio host Scott Graf with the mouth-watering update.
A drone delivering barbecue to fans at a football game? Tremendous! In fact,
that sounds too good to be true. Can you provide some evidence for this
fantastical assertion?

Well, alrighty then. Props to Idaho high school football fans, for providing us
with the as-yet best use for a drone.
