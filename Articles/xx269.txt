When other nations get drones

SECTION: Editorial; Pg. A22

LENGTH: 230 words


The Nov. 26 news article "Pakistan unveils homegrown drones" demonstrated
precisely why U.S. drone policy must change.

The U.S. drone program seems to be operating under the rationale that if we have
the drones, we make the rules. It operates without respect to national borders
or citizenship, striking countries with which we are not at war and killing at
least  four U.S. citizens. Reports from Amnesty International and Human Rights
Watch dispel the myth of precision, detailing gruesome civilian injuries and
casualties. "Signature strikes" target individuals not for their wrongdoings but
for their characteristics. No system of justice exists for those wrongfully
sentenced to death by U.S. drones.

U.S. officials have declined to provide transparency or oversight for the
program or to comply with international law. These policies harden anti-American
sentiment and weaken national security.

What if other countries used drones? Critics have often posed this question as a
cautionary hypothetical, yet it will soon be reality. Pakistan's unveiling of
its drone technology should be a warning to the U.S. government that now is the
time to introduce transparency, oversight and the rule of law into its drone
program. It is time to lead by example.
