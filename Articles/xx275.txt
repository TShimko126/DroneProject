To the Editor:

Re ''Mommy, the Drone's Here!'' (column, Dec. 4):

Maureen Dowd is leery of Amazon's plan to use drones buzzing overhead to deliver
packages. But this might just be a naming problem. After all, the military's
lethal targeting errors in the Middle East have given drones a bad image.

Jeff Bezos, the founder of Amazon, might try a customer-friendly name for his
tiny helicopters. Some possibilities: HeliDrop, the Dropster, ChopperDropper. Or
make it lovable with BuzzBuddy.

And what if you miss the text saying your package is on the doorstep? BuzzBuddy
could always ring twice.

To the Editor:

Maureen Dowd got it right when advising us to go shopping in a store. Jeff
Bezos's announcement of package delivery by drone was nothing but a shot across
the bow of Walmart as it's trying to catch up in e-commerce with Amazon.

Amazon's message is that it can deliver faster than going to Walmart's stores
when they are out of the way. Fortunately, there are still many choices in
between.
