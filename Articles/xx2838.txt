No place for immigrant children

I live in Carroll County, I am a Democrat, and I support Gov. Martin O'Malley's
(D) decision to oppose the placement of unaccompanied minors who crossed our
southern border at a proposed site here ["O'Malley stands fast in spat with
White House on migrant children," front page, July 17].

Carroll County is probably the most red county in the state. We have an
English-language law, militia guidelines and support one-denomination prayers at
public meetings, drone paranoia, public funds for private schooling   . . . and
the list goes on.

Mr. O'Malley is protecting the traumatized children from further trauma. After
the Carroll County site was proposed,  anti-immigration graffiti appeared on the
walls of the building, which  was nasty, dirty and had no adequate
accommodations.

I believe Mr. O'Malley's decision was solid and based on safety for the
children.
