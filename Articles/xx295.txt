Watch John Oliver go after President Obama on drones

"Last Week Tonight" on Sunday examined the United States' use of drone strikes
... and how we know so little about how the government is using them and how
they are justified.

Why don't we debate this subject more? John Oliver concluded that it might be
because drones are uncomfortable to think about - like the fact that Beck is a
Scientologist. "You don't want people reminding you about those kind of things,"
Oliver quipped.

It might also be because drone strikes are broadly popular among majorities of
the American public. Nearly everywhere else in the world, drone strikes are
universally despised.

It will be interesting to see how the debate over drone strikes changes as we
approach the 2016 presidential election; one sure-fire GOP candidate, Sen. Rand
Paul (R-Ky.) who a new New Yorker profile of the libertarian writes, is most
well-known "for his nearly thirteen-hour filibuster last year to protest the
administration's use of drones - a tactic that further convinced Republican
hawks that he doesn't share their assessment of the risks posed by terrorism."

Hillary Clinton, on the other hand, helped the Obama administration carry out
its expanded drone program while serving at the State Department.
