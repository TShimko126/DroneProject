Re ''Visiting Pakistan, Hagel Seeks to Shore Up Alliance'' (news article, Dec.
10):

If the United States is serious about addressing Pakistan's outrage over
continued drone strikes, it needs to start by investigating potentially unlawful
drone killings.

Across the border in Afghanistan, an American military commander apologized
after a drone strike allegedly killed a toddler last month and pledged an
investigation. Yet in Pakistan, the United States has never taken such steps.

The United States' silence on killings is speaking volumes. Instead of clinging
to official secrecy about a killing program of the Central Intelligence Agency
that has grown notorious, the administration should commit to investigations and
accountability for unlawful drone killings.
