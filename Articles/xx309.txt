LOS ANGELES -- Don't panic, that unmanned aircraft peering over your shoulder
might soon belong to Steven Spielberg or one of his functional equivalents.

The Federal Aviation Administration on Monday said that seven film production
companies had requested permission to use drones in their movie work -- it is
forbidden currently in the United States under a general prohibition against
commercial use of unmanned aircraft -- and the Motion Picture Association of
America quickly endorsed the applications.

''This new tool for storytellers will allow for creative and exciting aerial
shots,'' the association said in a statement.

The association, which represents the major film studios, pointed toward
improved safety on sets and an enhanced viewer experience as most ikely outcomes
of drone use in film work.

Potential commercial uses for drones have been proposed more frequently in
recent years. Amazon.com has already said the use of drones could speed its
deliveries, and some in the agriculture and energy businesses have considered
filing for exemptions from the prohibition, according to the F.A.A.

The agency is expected to come up with a plan for the expanded domestic use of
unmanned aircraft by next year.
