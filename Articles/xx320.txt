With its aerospace and high tech business communities, Colorado would have been
a logical choice for one of the federal government's test centers for unmanned
aerial devices, or drones.

Unfortunately, the Federal Aviation Administration concluded that six other
states were better choices for the drone test sites, and Colorado's application
was left out when the FAA announced the test site winners Monday.

Even so, we're happy to see the FAA moving forward on integrating unmanned
planes into the nation's airspace. Drones have tremendous potential to assist
government agencies, farmers and commercial enterprises in improving their
operations.

But crafting regulations governing drones will not be easy, so the sooner the
test sites are up and running the more quickly officials can get the answers
they need.
