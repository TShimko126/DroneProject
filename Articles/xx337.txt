The United Nations will start using surveillance drones for the first time in
the Democratic Republic of Congo on Tuesday, United Nations officials said
Monday. The drones will be used to monitor the volatile border between Congo and
Rwanda and the movements of armed groups in the region. The United Nations has a
huge peacekeeping mission in Congo, and the drones will be ''an important tool
to assist the mission in fulfilling its mandate to protect civilians,'' said a
United Nations spokesman, Martin Nesirky. The mission will start with two
drones, built by an Italian company, officials said.
