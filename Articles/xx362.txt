Real hunters don't use drones

We've said we oppose people being allowed to hunt drones, but we'd also oppose
hunting with drones.

The Colorado Parks and Wildlife Commission is considering outlawing the use of
unmanned aircraft to help hunters spot game, a practice that seems very
unsportsmanlike and downright lazy.

We know some people will ask what the difference is between using a drone to
locate elk or deer and using a fish finding sonar on a boat, but the skills a
hunter uses in finding game are an essential part of the undertaking. Hunting
isn't just hitting a target.

And besides, hunters already employ plenty of devices, including high tech guns
and scopes, special ammo, night vision scopes and game calls to take down prey.

Is it too much to ask that folks don't also send in a toy from RadioShack to
help make the kill?
