CORTEZ Local hemp advocates floated the idea to hunt for feral cannabis seeds
across the Four Corners via drone aircraft, but the measure was quickly
grounded.

The idea took flight this month after James McVaney, director of Industrial Hemp
in Colorado, notified local hemp activists that feral cannabis was known to grow
locally.

He provided two online maps, including one from the U.S. Department of
Agriculture.

"According to this U.S. government map, there is feral hemp growing in you all's
area," McVaney posted on the Hemp Talks Facebook page Oct. 1.

A second map from pollenlibrary.com that McVaney later shared "explicitly shows
that there is feral hemp in the Four Corners area," he posted to the social
media group.

McVaney relayed that a drone would be the easiest and quickest method to locate
potential seed sources.

Sharon Stewart, who organized the local Hemp Talks advocacy group, said she
inquired about renting a drone aircraft to search for feral cannabis along
riverbanks and gullies.

The effort was called off last week after it was determined it presented too
many liabilities. Stewart said local advocates were now focused on obtaining
global infrared imagery to possibly revisit the idea next fall.

"We simply didn't have enough time to locate a drone and plan a search this
year," Stewart said.
