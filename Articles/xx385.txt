Can drones be made safe?

SECTION: Editorial; Pg. A14

LENGTH: 229 words


"Hazard above" [front page, June 22-24], a three-part series on unmanned
aircraft systems known as UAS or drones,  was a missed opportunity. Having
recently retired from the Federal Aviation Administration's Office of Chief
Counsel, where I was the sole attorney working on draft rulemaking to regulate
the integration of UAS into the national airspace system, I was eager for an
insightful series that would shed light on the complex aviation safety
regulatory and policy issues associated with integration of UAS into the
national airspace.

While the series made the point that the UAS accident rate indicates the need
for a cautious approach, it didn't examine human factors and the extent to which
the man-machine interface may contribute to accidents.

The series also could have discussed the benefits of drone technology, including
those to public safety; agricultural operations; bridge, highway and pipeline
inspections; wildlife and fisheries management; and communications - all with
little risk and low cost.

The FAA faces novel challenges in regulating the design, production and
operation of aircraft without pilots while ensuring that integration of drones
into the national airspace does no harm. The agency has been working this issue
since the mid-1990s, yet it is still many months away from issuing proposed
rules on drones.
