Re ''Questions on Drone Strike Find Only Silence'' (front page, Nov. 23):

Faisal bin Ali Jaber, a Yemeni, says he doesn't question the drone program but
rather wants acknowledgment and an apology for the deaths of his nephew and
brother-in-law. That is why he traveled all the way to Washington. Indeed, that
is what victims of violence all over the world tell us they want: acknowledgment
for their losses.

The United States has a history doing just that. In Vietnam, Korea, Grenada and
more recently in Iraq and Afghanistan, American forces offered condolences and
often monetary payments to civilians they unintentionally harmed. Those gestures
went a long way toward defusing anger among victims. What makes drone victims in
Pakistan or Yemen different from those in Afghanistan? We and Mr. Jaber still
have no answers.
