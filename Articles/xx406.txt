Two drone strikes on Taliban compounds killed at least 10 militants on Tuesday,
officials said. The missile strikes, believed to be from United States drones,
occurred just hours apart in the North Waziristan tribal region near the Afghan
border, bringing the number of such strikes to three within 24 hours. The latest
ones hit compounds in the Datta Khel and Shawal areas. In June the military
launched a major offensive in North Waziristan, a rugged tribal area that has
long been home to local and foreign militants, including Al Qaeda.
