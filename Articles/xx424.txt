For the third time this summer, Yellowstone National Park rangers have cited a
tourist for illegally flying a drone in the park.

Park officials said Friday that Donald Criswell of Molalla, Ore., flew an
unmanned aircraft over Midway Geyser Basin and near bison on Aug. 19.

In early August, rangers charged Theodorus Van Vliet of the Netherlands after
his drone allegedly crashed into Grand Prismatic Spring.

Andreas Meissner of Germany is accused of flying a drone that crashed into
Yellowstone Lake on July 17.

He was charged earlier this week.
