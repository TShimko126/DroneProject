More than 400 large U.S. military drones have crashed in major accidents around
the world since 2001, according to a year-long Washington Post investigation. No
one has died in a drone accident, but the documents show that many catastrophes
have been narrowly averted, often by a few feet, or a few seconds, or pure luck.

Craig Whitlock, the reporter behind the investigation, talks to All Things
Considered and Nevada Public Radio about the future of the drone program.
