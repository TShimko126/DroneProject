C.I.A. Drone Bases

To the Editor:

In ''Afghanistan Exit Is Seen as Peril to Drone Mission'' (front page, Jan. 27),
you report the concern of intelligence agencies that they will lose the bases
from which to launch drone rocket strikes.

The Central Intelligence Agency should not be launching deadly military strikes.
We would be better off if the C.I.A. returned to being an agency that collected
and analyzed intelligence and stopped being a secretive paramilitary
organization.

With rare exceptions, if America cannot justify military action publicly, we
should not be taking military action.
