The opposition politician Imran Khan announced Thursday that his political
party, Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf, which governs the northwestern
Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa Province, would end its three-month blockade of a NATO supply
route. Mr. Khan's party imposed the blockade in November to protest American
drone strikes in Pakistan's tribal regions. On Thursday, party workers removed a
protest camp in Peshawar that was used to stop trucks heading toward the border
with Afghanistan. This week, a court in Peshawar ruled that the blockade was
illegal. A statement released by Mr. Khan's party said that ''the pressure of
the blockade had already resulted in a shift in the Obama administration's drone
policy, and as a result drones had been stopped for the present.''
