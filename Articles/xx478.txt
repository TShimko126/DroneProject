SANA, Yemen -- An airstrike killed 13 people suspected as Qaeda militants in the
central Yemeni province of al-Bayda on Saturday, a security official and tribal
representatives said. Three civilians in a nearby car were also killed, they
said.

''An airstrike targeted cars that suspected Al Qaeda militants were in and
killed 13 of them in the Sawma'a area of al-Bayda,'' a security official said.

The tribal members said a drone had been circling al-Bayda for days and on
Saturday struck two cars the suspected militants were in. Yemen has been
fighting Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula -- regarded by Washington as one of
the most lethal branches of the group -- but it still carries out significant
attacks against security forces in the country.

The United States conducts drone strikes as part of a campaign against Al Qaeda
in the Arabian Peninsula, which is based in Yemen. The country is among a
handful where the United States acknowledges using drones, although it does not
comment on the practice.
