When it comes to wedding photography, the sky is no longer the limit.
Camera-carrying drones not only take panoramic shots from high above the party,
but can also zoom in on the guests to shoot portraits. It's recommended that
there be a crew of at least two (a trained videographer and a pilot) to safely
take command of these machines. But if your newlyweds-to-be are D.I.Y. types and
think they can wrangle the personnel to safely take those shots, here is an
assortment of drones to buy. The results, as with almost everything, will vary.
