Deer Trail voters on target

Common sense has prevailed in Deer Trail, and for that we have voters to thank.

Residents went to the polls Tuesday and overwhelmingly shot down a ludicrous
proposal to issue drone hunting licenses.

At the same time, they voted out of office Mayor Frank Fields, who favored the
drone hunting idea that put the small town on the map and not in a good way.

Deer Trail had become a national laughingstock over the idea that it would sell
$25 drone hunting licenses to people who would then aim for the unmanned
aircraft.

The vote was the culmination of a long dispute over the proposal, which divided
the town's board of trustees, 3 3, in an August vote.

While some contended the idea had the same mixed support among voters, the
actual tally showed otherwise. Seventy three percent of those who went to the
polls voted against it.

Fields said the measure always was intended as a money raiser for this tiny
town, 55 miles east of Denver, not as a protest of government surveillance
methods.

Regardless, it was a silly idea that deserved the fate that voters dealt it.
