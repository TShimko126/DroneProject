FAA is dragging on drones

It's become increasingly clear that the major obstacle to the use of drones to
assist in tasks that would lower costs and improve productivity across a host of
commercial activities is not the technology but the Federal Aviation
Administration.

This lumbering agency is on a slow motion process of figuring out how to
regulate commercial drone use. And we do mean slow motion. Seven years after
asserting that commercial drones are illegal, the FAA is still trying to get its
regulatory act together.

And while the agency is expected to issue a formal rule by year's end, the head
of the FAA's unmanned aircraft office said recently that the entire rulemaking
could take seven to 10 more years, according to Forbes contributor John Goglia.

"So it seems that no rules are likely to be finalized until the end of 2021 at
the earliest and possibly not until 2024," Goglia wrote.

This footdragging will slow down the adaptation of a technology that could be
usefully deployed by farmers, rescuers, movie makers, news organizations, and
literally scores of other occupations. The FAA needs to get a move on.
