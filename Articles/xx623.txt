The danger in labeling a 'terrorist'

SECTION: Editorial; Pg. A18

LENGTH: 188 words


Beginning in 1988,  the United States placed the African National Congress, of
which Nelson Mandela was a leading figure, on an official list of "organizations
that engage in terrorism." Mr. Mandela himself was on the U.S. terrorist watch
list until 2008.

In a speech at Northwestern University in 2012, Attorney General Eric H. Holder
Jr. defended the killing of terrorists, designated as such by the executive
branch, as legal and as requiring no judicial review. Mr. Holder was responding
in particular to the 2011 drone killings of U.S. citizen Anwar al-Awlaki and his
16-year-old son. Prior to and since then, numerous such "terrorists" have been
killed.

If the U.S. government can err so completely as to view Mr. Mandela as a
terrorist threat until 2008, it can err today in deciding who is a terrorist. If
the United States had the drone capability and "legal" rationale decades ago
that it has today, it might have killed Mr. Mandela. There may be someone who
would have been a Mandela of the future had not he or she been killed, quite
"legally," by the U.S. government in a drone attack.
