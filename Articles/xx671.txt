The United States military has halted ground shipments of cargo leaving
Afghanistan via a key supply route through Pakistan to ensure the safety of
drivers after protests in Pakistan over American drone strikes, a Pentagon
spokesman said Tuesday. The route, which runs from Torkham Gate at the
Afghanistan-Pakistan border to the Pakistani port city of Karachi, accounts for
the vast majority of ground traffic of American military cargo through Pakistan
and has been targeted by protesters in Pakistan. The United States has other
ways to move cargo out of Afghanistan, but they are significantly more
expensive. The spokesman, Mark Wright, said the military expected to be able
resume its shipments through Pakistan in the near future.
