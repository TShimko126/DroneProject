A United Nations human rights panel has called for more oversight and
transparency in the program of targeted drone strikes carried out by the United
States and recommended the prosecution of all those involved in unlawful
killings and torture overseas, particularly ''persons in command positions.'' In
a report released Thursday, the United Nations Human Rights Committee, a panel
of 18 independent experts from different countries, expressed concern that the
United States government had not clarified the criteria or legal basis for drone
strikes and called for independent oversight of the program. It also drew
attention to the limited number of investigations into unlawful killings and the
use of torture in overseas operations by the American military and private
contractors. It said the responsibility of those who ''provided legal pretexts
for manifestly illegal behavior should also be established'' and urged the
government to declassify and release the Senate Intelligence Committee's
investigation into the Central Intelligence Agency's secret rendition
activities.
