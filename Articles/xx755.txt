SECTION: ASECTION; Pg. 2A

LENGTH: 282 words


Investigators are looking for a bank robber who wears a medical mask and totes a
portable oxygen tank.

The robber, who has hit at least three Denver banks, has been dubbed the "The O2
Bandit" because of the apparatus.

The robber has hit the following banks:

* Chase Bank, 3300 Colorado Blvd. at 11:39 a.m. on Dec. 7

* Westerra Credit Union, 3700 Quebec St., 9:30 a.m. on Dec. 13

* Partner Credit Union, 4000 Quebec St., 3:45 p.m. on Monday

The Denver Police Department and the FBI Rocky Mountain Safe Streets Task Force
are investigating the robberies.

Investigators aren't sure whether the bandit is dependent on supplemental
oxygen, or if it's part of an elaborate disguise.

The robber uses a demand note, according to an FBI media release.

He is described as a black man, between the ages of 50 and 60, between 5 feet, 8
inches and 6 feet tall, with a medium build.

Anyone with information on any of the robberies, or on a possible suspect, is
asked to call the FBI Rocky Mountain Safe Streets Task Force at 303 629 7171.

Anonymous tips can be left with Crime Stoppers at 720 913 STOP (7867) and a
reward of up to $2,000 is possible.

CU disappointed in feds' drone decision

Representatives of the University of Colorado and the local unmanned aviation
industry expressed deep disappointment over Monday's news that Colorado will not
be home to one of the Federal Aviation Administration's six planned drone test
sites.

CU led Colorado's bid to bring one of the national Unmanned Aircraft Systems, or
UAS, test sites to the state, but when FAA officials announced the locations of
the test sites across the country on Monday, Colorado did not make the cut.

The FAA chose from 25 proposals in 24 states.
