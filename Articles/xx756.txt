SANAA, YEMEN Yemeni forces, reportedly backed by U.S. drone strikes, hit al
Qaeda militants for a second straight day Monday in what Yemen officials said
was an assault on a major base of the terror group hidden in the remote southern
mountains. The government said 55 militants were killed so far.

The sprawling base was a rare instance of a permanent infrastructure set up by
al Qaeda's branch in the country, Yemeni security officials said. Built in the
past months, it includes a training ground, storehouses for weapons and food and
vehicles used by the group to launch attacks, they said, speaking on condition
of anonymity because they were not authorized to release details to the media.

The assault appeared to be a significant escalation in the U.S. and Yemeni
campaign against al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, the terror group's powerful
branch in the southern Arabian nation. The United States has been striking al
Qaeda positions in the country heavily with drones the past two years, trying to
cripple the group after it was driven out of several southern cities it took
over in 2011.
