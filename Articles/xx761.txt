U.S. CONDUCTS STRIKE IN SOMALIA AGAINST AL-SHABAB

The U.S. military carried out a counterterrorism strike Monday against leaders
of the militant group al Shabab in Somalia, Pentagon officials said, although it
was unclear whether the operation was successful.

Journalists in Somalia reported that suspected U.S. drones fired missiles near
the port city of Barawe, a stronghold for al Shabab. In a rare acknowledgment of
its clandestine military activities in Somalia, the Pentagon said it had
conducted a counterterrorism operation but gave no details.

The Pentagon statement did not say whether the operation was limited to drone
strikes or whether U.S. commandos had been present on the ground.

The U.S. government's Voice of America news service, which broadcasts programs
to Somalia, reported that a target of the attack may have been the alleged
mastermind of al Shabab's attack on an upscale shopping mall in Nairobi, Kenya,
in September 2013. Mukhtar Abu Zubeyr, also known as Godane, has emerged in
recent years as the primary leader of al Shabab and has ties to al Qaeda.

Voice of America, citing militants and African Union security sources in
Somalia, reported that Godane was in the vicinity of the attack, but his fate
was unknown. The report could not be independently verified.
