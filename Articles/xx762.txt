Wyoming lawmakers are considering a bill to ban law enforcement use of drones
without a warrant.

Members of the Wyoming Legislature's Joint Judiciary Committee are set to hear a
draft bill this week in Laramie.

If it's approved, the full Legislature could consider the measure early next
year.

Linda Burt, executive director of the American Civil Liberties Union in Wyoming,
says it's important for the state to set limits on the use of drones before they
become more prevalent in law enforcement. Others say police can act on
information they can see from an airplane.
