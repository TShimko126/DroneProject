Not everyone in Hollywood welcomes President Obama with open arms.

A street art campaign has sprung up in the Brentwood section of Los Angeles, an
all-politics-is-local protest against a Democratic National Committee
fund-raiser featuring Mr. Obama that will take place Thursday night at the home
of the actress Gwyneth Paltrow.

One poster features the phrase made famous by Ms. Paltrow as a euphemism for
divorce - "conscious uncoupling" - with a photo of Mr. Obama and the American
flag being torn in half. (Speaker John A. Boehner also used the phrase in a
sarcastic email blast pre-empting the president's economic address in California
on Thursday afternoon.)

Another piece of artwork features a photo of a smiling Ms. Paltrow in the style
of the famous Obama campaign poster, with the words "Obama Drone" replacing
"Hope."

The posters appear to be the work of the right-wing street artist Sabo, who has
been promoting them on his Twitter account, not of Ms. Paltrow's neighbors,
although some of them may be quietly enjoying the attacks.
