Netanyahu calls for immediate U.S.-Al Qaeda ceasefire

BYLINE: David Bernstein

LENGTH: 184 words


Here's a transcript of Netanyahu's remarks yesterday: Â "As I've said many times,
the United States has a right to defend itself against terrorist attacks from Al
Qaeda. And as a result of its war in Afghanistan, and drone strikes in Pakistan
and Yemen, the United States has already done significant damage to Al Qaeda's
infrastructure. I've also said, however, that we have serious concerns about the
rising number civilian deaths from drone strikes and the potential loss of
American lives from terrorism. And that is why it now has to be our focus and
the focus of the international community to bring about a cease-fire that ends
the fighting and that can stop the deaths of innocent civilians."

Admittedly, it seems strange for Netanyahu to be shedding what may appear to be
crocodile tears over civilian casualties, but given that Hamas actually attacked
and continued to attack Israel, it's not nearly as hypocritical as if the United
States, having killed or participated with Nato in the killing of thousands of
civilians in Serbia, Afghanistan, Iraq, Libya, Pakistan, and Yemen, was doing
the same.
