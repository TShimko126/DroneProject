Iraqi troops, combined with Kurdish forces from the northern part of Iraq, have
launched a ground offensive in an attempt to take back Mosul Dam from Islamic
State militants. They have key assistance, though: The U.S. military continues
to pound militant positions and targets, and,Â in the past few days, has turned
to target areas around the dam.

The stakes are high: The Islamic State has had control of the dam, Iraq's
largest, for about 10 days. If the militants decided to destroy it, it could
flood portions of the country as far south as Baghdad.

Here's what two airstrikes Saturday looked like, according to video just
released by U.S. Central Command. The first took out an armed truck, while the
second took out a militant Humvee, U.S. military officials said. It's likely
they were conducted by U.S. drones, perhaps Predator aircraft.

U.S. military officials said they launched nine airstrikes on Saturday and 14
more on Sunday, using a mix of fighter jets, bombers and drones.
