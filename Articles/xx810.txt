Michael Berry and Nabiha Syed, guest-blogging next week about Drone Law

BYLINE: Eugene Volokh

LENGTH: 107 words


I'm delighted to report that Michael Berry and Nabiha Syed (both of whom
practice media law at Levine Sullivan Koch & Schulz, LLP), authors of Journo-
Drones: A Flight over the Legal Landscape (published recently in the
Communications Lawyer), will be guest-blogging next week about drones and the
law.

I read and much enjoyed the article when I was preparing for my California
Assembly Committee testimony on the subject, and invited the authors to visit
with us, since I know this is a subject that many of our readers find as
interesting as I do. I'm very glad that Mr. Berry and Ms. Syed agreed, and I
very much look forward to their posts.
