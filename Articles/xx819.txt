More on drone law

BYLINE: David Post

LENGTH: 89 words


With all the talk here on the VC recently about drones and drone law and the
like, I thought some readers might be interested in the next version of the very
interesting "We Robot" conference series, coming up this spring at the
University of Washington Law School. Â We Robot has become the main gathering
place for those who are thinking about these questions from a legal/policy
standpoint, and, having attended the most recent version in Miami last spring, I
can tell you it's a pretty engaging crowd and a very stimulating discussion.
