DEER TRAIL A Colorado town that is considering issuing hunting permits for drone
aircraft has been given the go ahead for a special election on the matter.

A judge on Tuesday rejected a legal challenge that claimed the petition drive
was approved by a biased town clerk.

According to 7News, the election is expected to be held next year.

surveillance.

The proposal has drawn a stern warning from the Federal Aviation Administration,
which says shooting at unmanned aircraft is a crime. The Associated Press
