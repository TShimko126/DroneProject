Watch: Drone, hawk collide in the skies over Cambridge

Christopher Schmidt has been taking his quadcopter drone out for a spin a couple
of times a week since he purchased it six months ago, producing lots of
interesting footage for his YouTube page.

This weekend, those efforts were temporarily halted by some competing air
traffic. The aircraft collided with a hawk in midair above Magazine Beach Park
in Cambridge, Mass.

Schmidt is a software developer from Cambridge who says the quadcopter is a
great way to spend time outdoors with his daughter.  He says both the copter and
hawk came away with little damage.

"Equipment is fine. The reason it dropped was entirely because my first reaction
was to reduce throttle to reduce any risk to the hawk. It fell straight down,"
Schmidt said in an e-mail. "The hawk seemed completely non-plussed; he flew off
without any signs of damage."
