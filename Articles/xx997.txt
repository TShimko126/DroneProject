OK Go's latest music video is guaranteed to make you smile. Oh, and it was shot
with a drone.;
Watch to the very end for a mind-boggling finish.

OK Go has a penchant for making tremendously complex and amazing music videos.
Their latest is no different: aÂ highly choreographed routine set to "I Won't Let
You Down" - an incredibly catchy song in its own right, but the addition of
drone technology brings things to the next level. Needless to say, the film was
not shot in the United States (thanks, FAA!).
